CodeChef Difficulty 1102 Problem

Each goal gives +20 points

Each foul deducts -10 points

If the total points for a player are negative, their final score is considered 0

Your task is to compute the maximum score among all players in each test case.

Input
First line: An integer T — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First line: An integer N — number of players.

Second line: N space-separated integers — goals scored by players (A).

Third line: N space-separated integers — fouls committed by players (B).

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum score obtained by any player.
